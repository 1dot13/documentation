The settings available when starting a new game will vary depending on which release of 1.13 you are using.

| Progress Speed of Item Choices | Very Slow, Slow, **Normal**, Fast, Very Fast |  Controls the rate at which better equipment becomes available to both the player and the enemies. For example, if set to *Very Slow*, you will be using pistols and SMGs for a longer period of the game. |

## 3. Feature deep dive {#feature-deep-dive}

### 3.1 NCTH (New Chance to Hit) {#ncth}
Put simply, NCTH aims to be more realistic by taking into account many more factors when computing the chance to hit. Some players prefer to use OCTH as it is generally more consistent and easier to understand. [This article](https://ja2v113ham.fandom.com/wiki/New_Chance_To_Hit) goes into great detail about how NCTH works.


### 3.2 NIS/NAS {#nis-nas}
TODO

#### 3.2.1 NIS (New Inventory System) {#nis}

#### 3.2.2 NAS (New Attachment System) {#nas}


## 4. Starter tips

### 4.1 Tips on actually hitting things in NCTH
- Optics make a huge difference. Once you secure Drassen airport, consider ordering 2x scopes from Bobby Ray.
- Before optics, consider attacking at night.
- Auto fire (and by extension, suppression) is very effective.

### 4.2 Who are some good mercs to initially hire?
TODO  
Generally, it is very useful to have a decent marksman, a medic and a mechanic around.  
Barry, Buns, Grunty, Igor, Fox, Wolf, Meltdown, Stephen, Grizzly

### 4.3 Basic strategy and tactics for early game
- A merc ending the turn with leftover AP will have a greater chance to trigger an interrupt.
- Lower stances make it harder for a merc to be seen and harder to be hit.
- Make sure your mercs sleep every so often.
- When prone or crouching near cover a merc can "rest their weapon", improving their accuracy.
- When you have captured most of a city, train militia to defend the city while you are elsewhere.
- Suppressive fire reduces the target's AP so it can be very effective.
