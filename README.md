## 0.1 Preamble

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This document is an attempt to create clear and structured starter documentation for people who want to start playing 1.13.  
From years of hanging around in the Bears Pit community we noticed there's a complete lack of explanation how to get started with this mod and everything surrounding it.  

## 0.2 What is 1.13

Jagged Alliance 2 v1.13 is a MODIFICATION for the Jagged Alliance 2 game, with a host of new features and improvements, as well as externalizing a lot of data to make modding easier.  
Lots of features have been added like new resolutions, improved AI, weather effects and new items, 1.13 does still contain the original maps and quests.  
The 1.13 mod has been structured in such a way that it can be used as a baseline for creating new mods.

# 1 Installation

To install 1.13 you will have to go through a few steps

## 1.1 Jagged Alliance 2

To be able to play 1.13 you will need to own the Jagged Alliance 2 game itself, there are several places where you can still get the game, for example:  

- GOG https://www.gog.com/game/jagged_alliance_2
- Steam https://store.steampowered.com/app/1620/Jagged_Alliance_2_Gold/

After you got your hand on a copy of JA2 and want to go install it, we have a few tips for you to make sure everything runs smooth.

- Don't install the game to a default folder like "Program Files" or "Program Files (x86)", instead make a folder "C:\Games" (depending on your disk setup) and install the game there.
- After installing Jagged Alliance, make a backup of the folderso you dont have to do a reinstallation each time you want to start from scratch, so for example copy "C:\Games\Jagged Alliance 2" to a backup copy, technically you can make endless copies of the JA2 folder for different 1.13 mod based installations, naming of the folder doesn't matter.

## 1.2 the 1.13 mod

Once you have your clean JA2 installation ready to be turned into a clean 1.13 installation, there are a few routes you can go to achieve this.

- Install the latest SCI, this is the best way to go, these SCI packages are based upon the latest game developments but dont worry, they are very stable.
- Install the old so called "stable" release which is referred to as 7609, some mods chose to stick to this version so check what your goal mod requires.
- Install 1.13 via the SVN route, this is an expert path because next to getting all the mod files from SVN you will have to compile the games executable file from source code as well

### 1.2.1 Install the latest SCI

This is the preferred way to go for people who want to start playing 1.13, it will give you a good out of the box experience.  
You can get the latest SCI file from the following OneDrive location [link](https://onedrive.live.com/?id=13A6926EAC52083!583&cid=013A6926EAC52083)  
If you sort the OneDrive file listing from new to old you should see the file with the highest revision number up on top, download this one.  

Once you have downloaded the file you will need to extract it, there are different tools to use for this like [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/ "7-Zip homepage")  
Extract the file to the location where your target JA2 installation is located and choose to overwrite files if you get asked, so for this example we'll use "C:\Games\Jagged Alliance 2\"  

### 1.2.2 Install release 7609

For the special cases with a requirement to run on release 7609, you can find it on the [official 1.13 wiki site](http://ja2v113.pbworks.com/w/page/4218334/Downloads)

### 1.2.3 Install 1.13 from SVN

If you have a special reason to not use the SCI release, for example if you are actively helping to fix bugs in 1.13, it can be handy to get your gamedata and executable from source, this is however an advanced topic
